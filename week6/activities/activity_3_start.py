# # Create a Graph Class:
# # Implement a Graph class to represent the map.
# # The Graph class should allow adding locations as vertices and connections between them as edges.
# # Add Locations and Connections:
# # Add a few locations with specific names and latitudes.
# # Connect these locations to simulate a map.
# # Display the Map:
# # Print the connections between locations to visualize the map structure.
#
# from dataclasses import dataclass
# # Define a Location Data Class
# # Include name and latitude/longitude attributes.
# class Location:
#     name: str
#     # latitude: float
#     # longitude: float
#
# class Graph:
#     def __init__(self):
#         # Dictionary to store location names as keys and lists of connected locations as values
#         pass
#
#     def add_location(self, location):
#         # Create an empty list for each location's connections
#         # Each location is now a vertice in the graph object
#         pass
#
#
#     def add_connection(self, location1_name, location2_name):
#         pass
#         # Search the dicitonary keys for the two locations
#
#             # Add the connection bidirectionally
#             # If both keys are found connect them by adding each to the Locations list
#             # Check if location 2 is in the vertice for location 1
#
#                 # If location 2 is not there add to the location 1 list
#
#             # Check if location 2 is in the vertice for location 1

#         #     print(f"One or both locations '{location1_name}' and '{location2_name}' do not exist in the graph.")
#
#
# # Example usage:
# def main():
#     # Step 1: Create 3 Locations exzmple
#     location1 = Location(name="LocationA", latitude=40.7128, longitude=30.7008)
#
#     # Step 2: Create a Graph and Add Locations
#     graph = Graph()
#
#     # Step 3: Add Connections - example usage
#     graph.add_connection("LocationA", "LocationB")
#
#
#     # Step 4: Display the Graph (Map)
#     print("Map representation:")
#     # graph.display()
